# About Me

Hi, I’m **Alex Tran** — a developer and builder who loves turning ideas into systems that work.

I split my time between **🇻🇳 Ho Chi Minh City** and **🇦🇺 Melbourne**, living between two worlds: one rooted in engineering craft and the other in family life with **Romie** and our son **Milo**.

When I’m not building software, I’m usually **engineering my home** — automating lights, sensors, and routines through **Home Assistant**.  
It’s my favorite kind of project: where code, design, and everyday life meet.

And when it’s time to slow down, I turn to **piano**, **mechanical keyboards**, or quiet evenings with family — the kind of small systems that make life feel intentional.

## 🧠 What I Do

I work at the intersection of **engineering**, **AI**, and **product thinking** — building systems that blend performance, simplicity, and human intent.

My foundation was shaped in **Australia**, where I studied **Computer Science** and began my career as a software engineer.  
Those early years taught me the value of reliability, craftsmanship, and thoughtful design — the quiet disciplines that separate a working product from a lasting one.

Later, I moved to **Southeast Asia**, where I led **product and growth teams** at **Grab**, **Lazada**, and **ShopBack** — building payments, logistics, and loyalty systems that serve millions across the region.  
It was the kind of work that sits at the _heart of SEA_: high-stakes, high-scale, and deeply human.

That contrast — between the structure of Australia and the dynamism of Southeast Asia — still shapes how I build.  
I think like an engineer, but design like a product person: connecting systems back to experience, and complexity back to clarity.

My work spans:

- Scalable backend architectures with **Python**, **FastAPI**, and **PostgreSQL**
- Frontend experiences in **Next.js** and **TypeScript**
- AI-driven development tools and automation agents
- Observability and DevOps stacks on **AWS**, **Redis**, and **Tempo**

Earlier, I also worked at **Fossil Group**, bridging hardware, software, and design in the **smartwatch ecosystem** — a lesson in diversity of craft, from firmware to storytelling.

Lately, I’ve been exploring how **AI reshapes the act of building** —  
how tools like Cursor and LLM-powered agents can plan, reason, and collaborate like engineers, while keeping human judgment and creativity at the center.

## 🎹 Beyond Code

I believe engineering and music share the same rhythm: structure meets emotion.  
Playing piano helps me slow down — a reminder that craft matters as much as speed.

Building **custom mechanical keyboards** is another quiet obsession — there’s something poetic about assembling the tools you use to create, one switch at a time.
