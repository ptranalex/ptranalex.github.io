## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Alex Tran** â€” a developer and product thinker who loves building meaningful software and sharing what I learn along the way.  
Iâ€™ve spent the past decade leading teams, designing systems, and exploring how technology â€” especially AI â€” can amplify human creativity and decision-making.

## What I Do

I work across the intersection of **engineering, product, and AI**, focusing on:

- ðŸ§© **System Design & Backend Engineering** â€” architecting scalable, observable systems built with Python (FastAPI), Postgres, and Redis
- ðŸŽ› **Automation & Data Workflows** â€” connecting APIs, data, and devices (Home Assistant, LLM agents, internal tools)
- ðŸ§  **AI-Augmented Development** â€” experimenting with LLMs, vector search, and agent frameworks to push developer productivity
- ðŸš€ **Technical Leadership** â€” mentoring engineers and bridging product vision with technical execution

## My Journey

I started my career as a **software engineer in Australia**, later transitioning into **product management** roles at **Grab, Lazada, MoMo, and ShopBack**, where I led teams across e-commerce, payments, and growth.

After nearly a decade in product, Iâ€™ve returned to my roots in engineering â€” combining both worlds to build systems that are **technically robust and product-driven**.

Today, I split my time between coding, writing, and mentoring teams on how to build software that lasts.

## This Site

This site is powered by **Jekyll** with the **Minimal Mistakes** theme, and hosted on **GitHub Pages**.  
It serves as my **engineering notebook** â€” part blog, part portfolio â€” where I document what I build, what I learn, and how I think about technology.
