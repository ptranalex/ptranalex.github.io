## Project Overview

**NextWatch** is a movie discovery platform designed to help users find what to watch next ‚Äî powered by a custom vector-based recommendation engine.

The system combines structured movie metadata with semantic embeddings to provide personalized recommendations that go beyond genres or ratings.

---

## Key Features

- üé¨ **Vector Search Recommendations** ‚Äî built with Qdrant and OpenAI embeddings
- ‚öôÔ∏è **FastAPI Backend** ‚Äî modular microservice architecture with caching and observability
- üí° **Next.js Frontend** ‚Äî optimized for fast browsing and responsive design
- üß† **LLM-Ready Design** ‚Äî supports AI-assisted movie summaries and conversational search

---

## Architecture & Technologies

- **Backend:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Infra:** AWS EC2, GitHub Actions, Docker
- **Monitoring:** OpenTelemetry, Tempo

---

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Efficient Vector Search at Scale

Implemented **multi-layer caching (Redis + in-memory L1)** to keep search latency under 50 ms even with tens of thousands of vectors.

### Challenge: Data Consistency Across Services

Designed a shared core module (`movie-storage`) to unify data logic between importers, APIs, and frontends.

---

## Results

- üöÄ Search latency reduced by ~65%
- üß† Improved recommendation relevance (higher click-through in internal tests)
- üß© Modularized architecture for future ML extensions

---

## Lessons Learned

Building NextWatch reinforced the value of clean abstractions, strong observability, and balancing system design with product experience.

The next step: evolving it into a full recommendation API for multi-media content.
