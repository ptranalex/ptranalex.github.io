I didn’t plan to track my Cursor usage obsessively. But when I looked back at my stats, they told a surprisingly clear story — not just about how much I used an AI editor, but how my way of building, thinking, and shipping software has changed.

This post is a reflection on that journey.

_Snapshot from my Cursor 2025 stats._

## The numbers (at a glance)

- **Joined**: ~494 days ago
- **Usage percentile**: Top 36%
- **Most used models**:
  - Claude 4 Sonnet
  - Claude 3.7 Sonnet
  - Auto
- **Agents created**: 7.4K
- **Tabs opened**: 3.7K
- **Tokens consumed**: 1.99B
- **Current streak**: 34 days

At first glance, this looks like “heavy usage.” In reality, it reflects something more structural.

## Cursor is not an editor — it’s an operating system for thinking

The most misleading metric here is tokens.

**1.99B tokens doesn’t mean I typed a lot.** It means I externalized thinking at scale.

Cursor became:

- A design reviewer
- A senior engineer pair
- A documentation engine
- A ruthless simplifier
- A planning partner

I stopped asking **“how do I write this?”** and started asking **“what is the cleanest system here?”**

That shift compounds.

## Why Claude Sonnet dominates my usage

I consistently gravitated toward Claude Sonnet models — not because they’re flashy, but because they’re predictable under pressure.

What mattered most:

- Long-context reasoning
- Calm refactoring
- Structured explanations
- Lower hallucination rate when systems get complex

For architecture, refactors, and multi-file reasoning, **reliability beats cleverness**.

## 7.4K agents ≠ experiments — they’re reusable brains

Agents weren’t disposable prompts. They evolved into:

- “Golden path” enforcers
- Planning agents
- Code reviewers
- Migration assistants
- Documentation generators

Each agent encoded a standard I didn’t want to renegotiate every time.

This is the real unlock:

> You don’t scale productivity by working faster.  
> You scale it by making good decisions cheaper.

## Tabs, context, and the end of cognitive thrash

3.7K tabs sounds chaotic.

In practice, Cursor reduced context switching:

- Specs live next to code
- Design docs evolve with implementation
- TODOs are embedded in execution

The editor stopped being a place where work happens, and became the place where work is decided.

## The 34-day streak is the most important metric

Not tokens. Not models. Not percentile.

**Consistency.**

A daily streak means:

- Small, compounding improvements
- No “big bang” rewrites
- Continuous refactoring of both code and thinking

This is how real systems — and careers — are built.

## What changed most for me

Before Cursor:

- I optimized for correctness
- I hesitated before starting
- I over-planned to avoid rework

After Cursor:

- I bias toward action
- I prototype aggressively
- I refactor without fear

The cost of being wrong dropped dramatically. That changed everything.

## Final thought

These stats aren’t about flexing usage. They’re a snapshot of a deeper transition:

From executing tasks  
to designing systems with AI as a first-class collaborator.

Cursor didn’t make me faster. It made me more decisive, more structured, and more ambitious.

And that’s the kind of tooling that actually compounds.
