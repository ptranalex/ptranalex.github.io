💡 _“Are we living in a golden age of stupidity?”_ — The Guardian asked this recently.  
And it stuck with me.

Because I’ve been thinking about something else —  
how we decide what to delegate to AI,  
and what to protect as human craft.

### What I Happily Delegate

✅ The repetitive, mechanical work:

- Summarizing long documents
- Cleaning messy data
- Transcribing or formatting notes
- Generating first drafts or brainstorming ideas

These tasks free up space — mental and emotional — to focus on the meaningful parts.

---

### What I Don’t

⚠️ The things that make thinking human:

- Deep reasoning and judgment
- Crafting narratives that require empathy and tone
- The slow, messy process that transforms learning into understanding

AI isn’t making us stupid.  
It’s just making it easier to skip the hard parts of thinking.  
That’s on _us_ to manage.

### The Real 2025 Skill

Maybe the skill that matters most now isn’t _prompt engineering_ —  
it’s **delegation judgment**.

Knowing _when_ to let AI help,  
and _when_ to stay in the discomfort of doing it ourselves.

### The Parenting Mirror

👨‍👧🤖 As a parent, that question feels even bigger:  
How will the next generation learn — and think — in an AI world?

It’s no longer _if_ or _when_.  
It’s _how_ they’ll build a mind in a world where thinking itself can be outsourced.

My 10-year-old already rolls her eyes when I say:

> “Let me check with GPT.”

She’ll sigh,

> “Dad, maybe just use your brain for once.” 😅

Maybe she’s right.  
Maybe wisdom in the AI age starts with knowing when _not_ to ask it.
