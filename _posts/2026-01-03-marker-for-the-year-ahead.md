This blog isn’t about big declarations. It’s about how we think about our work, our teams, and the systems we build to last.

2026 feels less like a reset and more like a refinement.

## A note for 2026

I’m orienting this year around three themes:

### Depth over motion

Fewer things, taken further.

Ship less noise. Build systems people trust.

### Craft over velocity

Fundamentals that compound.

Great work isn’t always fast — but it always lasts.

### Leverage over effort

Smarter paths over harder paths.

Better abstractions, clearer ownership, stronger teams.

## What this shapes

This shapes:

- The questions I ask before starting anything
- How I invest my attention and energy
- What I choose to publish here

No big aspirational list.

Just an invitation to think more deeply and build more meaningfully, together.

— See you in the next post.
