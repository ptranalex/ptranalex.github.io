> “People are wired very differently, and if you don’t understand that, you’ll keep expecting apples from an orange tree.”  
> — _Ray Dalio, Principles_

When I first read _Principles_, this line stopped me cold.  
It sounds obvious — yet it’s one of the hardest truths to apply as a leader.

We all say we value diversity.  
But most hiring decisions, performance reviews, and team conflicts happen because we still assume everyone should think, react, or work like _us._

---

### 🧠 We’re Not Built the Same

Some people think in systems.  
Others think in stories.  
Some thrive in chaos.  
Others need structure to do their best work.

In _Principles_, Dalio calls this “different wiring.”  
In practice, it means: people don’t just differ in skill — they differ in **how they process reality**.

Great hiring isn’t about finding _the best person._  
It’s about finding **the right person for the environment, the role, and the rhythm.**

### ⚙️ The Hiring Mistake We All Make

Early in my career, I made a quiet but costly hiring mistake:  
I looked for people who _worked like me._

People who were fast, analytical, systems-minded — great under pressure.  
And it worked for a while — until it didn’t.

Because when everyone solves problems the same way,  
you build a team that moves quickly in one direction — even if it’s the wrong one.

Diversity of wiring isn’t about backgrounds or demographics.  
It’s about **mental models**.  
The way people reason, argue, decide, and recover from mistakes.

### 🧩 Hiring for Wiring

When hiring now, I look less for _experience_ and more for **fit to the problem set**.

Questions I ask myself:

- Does this role need a finisher or a starter?
- A risk-taker or a stabilizer?
- A creative connector or a precise executor?
- Someone who thrives in ambiguity or needs crisp process?

Every project, like every system, needs balance —  
builders and polishers, thinkers and doers, optimists and realists.

Hiring is not about cloning culture.  
It’s about **completing** it.

---

### 🌱 Building With Awareness

Once you see wiring differences, everything changes.  
You stop judging, start designing.

- You pair people with complementary strengths.
- You set expectations based on nature, not fantasy.
- You build systems that _fit humans_, instead of breaking them.

Good leadership isn’t about forcing everyone to adapt to your rhythm.  
It’s about creating conditions where everyone can operate at their natural best.

### 💬 The Hard Part: Letting Go of “Should”

The hardest part of applying this principle is emotional, not operational.  
It’s letting go of _should_ —  
“She should be more assertive.”  
“He should move faster.”  
“They should care more.”

No.  
They’re wired differently.

And once you stop trying to rewrite people,  
you can finally start **rearranging systems** so they can succeed as themselves.

---

### 💬 The Takeaway

People are not broken versions of you.  
They’re **different instruments** in the same orchestra.

Your job as a leader isn’t to make them play like you.  
It’s to help them play in tune — together.

---

💡 **Quick takeaway:**  
Build teams by understanding wiring, not rewriting it.  
You don’t optimize people; you orchestrate them.
