_Day one on Cursor, I literally said:_

> “Don’t code until I give you my green light.” 😄

That was my first pain point — I wanted AI to **plan first, act later**.

At the time, I was deep in **Home Assistant YAML configs** — the messy kind:  
2,000-line files full of sensors, scenes, automations, and switches.  
Every change felt like defusing a bomb.

I wanted help organizing, but not a co-pilot that rewrote everything blindly.  
I wanted it to **think first, then act** — like a good engineer.

### 🧩 When AI Starts Thinking Like an Engineer

Fast forward to today — and Cursor just shipped **Plan Mode**.  
It’s exactly what I imagined that first day.

Before writing a single line, Cursor pauses.  
It lays out a clear plan:

- what it will modify
- why it’s doing it
- and how those changes affect the codebase

Only after I approve does it execute.

That’s not just a UX tweak —  
that’s a **shift in philosophy**: from autocomplete to _collaborator_.

### ⚙️ My Test Case: Home Assistant Chaos

The screenshot I shared shows Cursor methodically reorganizing my Home Assistant templates:  
splitting sensors into logical groups, refactoring repetitive YAML blocks, and adding comments.

It’s small, but powerful — the difference between an assistant that guesses,  
and one that **shows its reasoning**.

When AI outlines a plan and waits for human sign-off,  
it moves from _fast coder_ to _engineering partner_.  
That’s the future.

### 🚀 Why This Matters

Most developers don’t need AI that types faster.  
We need AI that **thinks better** —  
that helps structure ideas, refactor chaos, and reason about systems.

Plan Mode hints at that next step:  
a workflow where humans and tools share _intent_ before action.

It’s not just faster coding —  
it’s **smarter delegation**.

### ❤️ The Direction Feels Right

I’ve used every AI coding tool out there,  
but this one hits differently —  
because it feels designed for how engineers actually work:  
think → plan → build.

Absolutely love this direction.
