# Hello and Welcome! 🎉

I’m excited to finally share this new space — my personal blog and engineering notebook, built with **Jekyll** and the **Minimal Mistakes** theme.

After years of writing privately in snippets, I wanted a place that feels like _my digital workshop_: where I can publish ideas, document projects, and reflect on the craft of building software.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

This blog is a collection of **essays, deep dives, and experiments** around topics that matter most to me:

- 🧩 **Engineering & System Design** — lessons from building scalable backend systems and data pipelines
- ⚙️ **Automation & Tools** — projects that make everyday workflows faster, smarter, and more fun
- 🧠 **AI & Productivity** — exploring how large language models and agents are reshaping software creation
- 🚀 **Career & Leadership** — reflections on leading teams and bridging the gap between product and engineering

Each post is short, honest, and focused on sharing something useful — either a concept, a decision, or a framework that I found valuable.

## ⚙️ Why Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes?

I chose this stack because it’s **simple, fast, and long-term friendly**:

1. 🧱 **Static by design** — no backend, no maintenance, just pure Markdown rendered as HTML
2. 🌍 **Native GitHub Pages support** — automatic deployment every time I push a commit
3. ✍️ **Markdown-first workflow** — write anywhere, version in Git
4. 🎨 **Minimal Mistakes theme** — polished, responsive, and customizable without complexity

It’s the perfect foundation for a personal engineering blog — low friction, high clarity, and fully under my control.

## 🔭 What’s Next

I’ll be posting regularly about topics like:

- building and scaling **NextWatch**, my movie discovery platform
- experimenting with **AI summarization agents** and automation pipelines
- insights from **transitioning between product and engineering leadership**

You can explore my [portfolio](/portfolio/) to see what I’ve built, or visit the [about page](/about/) for more about my background.

Thanks for stopping by — and welcome to my corner of the internet.  
I hope you find something here that sparks a thought or inspires you to build.
