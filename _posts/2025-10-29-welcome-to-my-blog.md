I'm Alex — a builder at heart, rediscovering the craft of engineering after years leading product and technology teams.

This blog is my **digital workshop** — a place to explore ideas, document projects, and reflect on how we build software, systems, and teams in an era shaped by AI.

## 🧭 What You’ll Find Here

I write about **engineering, AI, and the evolving craft of building** — where tools, systems, and human judgment intersect:

- 🧩 **Engineering & System Design** — lessons from building scalable backend systems, APIs, and data pipelines
- ⚙️ **Automation & Tools** — experiments that make workflows faster, cleaner, and more enjoyable
- 🧠 **AI & Human Productivity** — exploring how large language models and agents are reshaping the way we think and code
- 🚀 **Career & Leadership** — reflections on leading teams and bridging the gap between product and engineering

Each post is short, practical, and written with intent — sharing something I’ve learned, tested, or questioned along the way.

## ⚙️ Why Jekyll and Chirpy?

I wanted a setup that feels as **engineering-pure** as the ideas it hosts — minimal, fast, and fully under my control.

1. 🧱 **Static by design** — no backend, no maintenance, just Markdown rendered as HTML
2. 🌍 **GitHub-native** — every commit becomes a published post
3. ✍️ **Markdown-first workflow** — clean, distraction-free writing that fits my developer habits
4. 🎨 **Chirpy theme** — simple, dark-mode friendly, and focused on the words, not the widgets

It’s a setup that rewards clarity over complexity — the same principle I try to apply to code and systems.

## 🔭 What’s Next

I’ll be writing about:

- building and scaling **NextWatch**, my movie discovery platform
- designing **AI summarization agents** and automation pipelines
- lessons from **transitioning between product and engineering leadership**

Thanks for stopping by — and welcome to my corner of the internet.  
If any post sparks an idea or a question, I’d love to hear from you.  
Let’s keep building things that matter.
