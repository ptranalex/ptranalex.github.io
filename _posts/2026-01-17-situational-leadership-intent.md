For a long time, I noticed a pattern in my leadership that I didn’t fully understand — and honestly, I wasn’t always comfortable admitting it.

I consistently excelled when working with high performers and juniors who showed strong attitude and a growth mindset. But I struggled — sometimes deeply — with juniors who lacked ownership, curiosity, or willingness to improve.

At first, I questioned myself.

Was I being unfair? Impatient? Not empathetic enough as a leader?

Situational leadership helped me answer that question — but not in the way most leadership articles describe it.

This is how I’ve come to apply situational leadership personally, shaped by experience rather than theory.

## The blind spot in classic situational leadership

Situational leadership traditionally asks you to diagnose two things:

- **Competence** — can the person do the job?
- **Confidence** — do they believe they can?

That framework is useful — but incomplete for me.

It didn’t explain why:

- I could happily spend hours coaching an inexperienced junior who asked thoughtful questions
- Yet feel drained and ineffective coaching another junior with the same skill level

The missing variable was obvious in hindsight.

## The third dimension I couldn’t ignore: intent

Over time, I realized I was already using a third diagnostic axis — just unconsciously.

**Intent**: the willingness to learn, take ownership, and grow.

Once I made this explicit, everything clicked.

I wasn’t reacting to seniority or skill gaps. I was reacting to **pull vs. push**:

- People with intent create **pull** — they seek clarity, feedback, and responsibility
- People without intent require constant **push** — reminders, enforcement, repetition

My leadership style naturally amplifies pull. It struggles with push-heavy situations.

That’s not an excuse. It’s a reality to work with.

## Why I thrive with juniors who have a growth mindset

When a junior shows:

- Curiosity
- Preparation
- Follow-through

I instinctively shift into high-support coaching mode:

- I explain context, not just tasks
- I share mental models, not just answers
- I invest time because I see compounding returns

These juniors don’t just improve — they accelerate. And I, in turn, feel energized rather than depleted.

This is situational leadership at its best: **high direction + high support → rapid growth**.

## Why I struggle with juniors who lack attitude

When intent is missing, situational leadership *on paper* says I should:

- Increase structure
- Increase coaching
- Be patient

In reality, something else happens:

- Effort doesn’t compound
- Feedback doesn’t stick
- The same issues repeat

What drains me isn’t low skill. It’s low ownership.

That’s when I learned a hard but important lesson:

> Situational leadership is a diagnostic tool — not an obligation to invest endlessly.

## How I apply situational leadership differently now

### 1) I diagnose intent early

Beyond skill and confidence, I look for signals:

- Are questions thoughtful or passive?
- Is feedback acted on?
- Do they prepare, or wait to be told?

Intent shows up quickly if you pay attention.

### 2) I make the leadership contract explicit

With juniors who struggle, I say this early (in my own words):

> “I’ll support you closely at the start.  
> But effort, curiosity, and ownership are expected.  
> If those don’t show up, we’ll need to change how we work together.”

This creates clarity — for them and for me.

### 3) I time-box heavy coaching

Instead of open-ended patience:

- I set a short window (2–4 weeks)
- I define observable behaviors
- I reassess based on evidence, not hope

This keeps coaching **intentional rather than emotional**.

### 4) I scale investment, not respect

This was a mindset shift.

I don’t treat everyone identically — but I treat everyone fairly.

I adapt my leadership style to capability, but I scale my investment based on intent.

That’s not favoritism. That’s sustainable leadership.

## What situational leadership means to me now

Situational leadership isn’t about being endlessly flexible or endlessly patient.

It’s about:

- Meeting people where they are
- And being honest about how far they’re willing to walk

Some people need guidance. Some need confidence. Some need boundaries.

And some — despite support — aren’t ready.

Recognizing that doesn’t make you a bad leader. It makes you an accurate one.

## Closing thought

I no longer judge my leadership by how much I give, but by whether my investment creates growth.

Situational leadership, applied personally, isn’t about saving everyone.

It’s about creating conditions where those who want to grow can truly thrive — and having the courage to stop pushing when growth isn’t being met halfway.

That’s the version of leadership I stand by.
