I came across a short but powerful article from Simon Sinek —  
[**Why the Best Leaders Know When to Keep Their Mouths Shut**](https://simonsinek.com/stories/why-the-best-leaders-know-when-to-keep-their-mouths-shut/),  
featuring a conversation with former Navy SEAL commander **Jocko Willink**.

### 🧠 The Idea That Stuck

> “When that leadership vacuum occurs, I’m going to give it at least enough time that everybody feels it.” — Jocko Willink

Most leaders rush to fill silence, thinking decisiveness equals value.  
But silence, used deliberately, becomes a **tool for trust**.  
It gives others the space — and permission — to step up.

### ⚖️ Decisiveness ≠ Dominance

Jocko’s insight reframes leadership from _control_ to _creation_:  
the best leaders aren’t the fastest to answer — they’re the ones who **create the conditions** for better answers to emerge.

It’s not about speaking first.  
It’s about knowing **when to**.

### ❤️ Why This Resonates

In my own experience leading product and engineering teams,  
the best discussions often started when I didn’t rush to speak.  
Silence drew out perspectives that shaped better outcomes.

That space — uncomfortable at first —  
is where **ownership, creativity, and trust** begin to form.

---

### 🪞Quick Reflection

Leadership isn’t about having all the answers.  
It’s about holding the silence long enough  
for your team to find the right ones together.
