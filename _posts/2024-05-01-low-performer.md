> “People rarely fail on purpose.  
> More often, they drift — slowly, quietly — until one day they realize they’ve lost the rhythm.”

We like to believe performance is a matter of effort.  
That the best people simply _try harder_ — and the ones who fall behind somehow don’t.

But after years of leading teams across product, engineering, and operations,  
I’ve learned that underperformance is rarely a lack of effort.  
It’s a symptom of **misalignment** — between person, purpose, and system.

### ⚙️ When Systems Shape People

No one wakes up deciding to underperform.  
They fall behind gradually — through unclear goals, shifting priorities, and missing feedback loops.

A high performer in one environment can feel average in another.  
A struggling engineer can become a star when the team, the process, or the manager changes.

Performance is never just personal.  
It’s **contextual** — an echo of the system people work inside.

### 💡 The Slow Drift

It usually doesn’t start with failure.  
It starts with **confusion**.

A sprint goal that no longer connects to a bigger picture.  
A product change that shifts what “success” means overnight.  
A lack of feedback because “everyone’s busy.”

People don’t disengage all at once — they _fade_.  
One unclear sprint at a time.

And by the time we notice, they’ve already started believing the label we gave them: “low performer.”

### 🧭 The Leadership Blind Spot

When someone falls behind, it’s tempting to zoom in on the individual.  
But good leadership zooms out — to the system.

Before I call anyone “underperforming,” I ask myself:

- Did I make expectations _explicit and observable_?
- Have I given them the feedback they needed _early enough_ to act on it?
- Do they even understand how their work connects to the bigger goal?
- Have I made it safe for them to admit when they’re lost?

Because most of the time, they’re not failing —  
they’re trying to survive _without enough information_.

### 🌱 The Human Side of Decline

Sometimes it’s not about the system at all.  
It’s about **life**.

Burnout. Grief. Fatigue. Parenthood. Health.  
Things we pretend don’t spill into work — until they do.

I’ve seen brilliant people lose spark not because they stopped caring,  
but because life demanded more than they had left to give.

Empathy doesn’t mean lowering the bar.  
It means understanding what someone’s _carrying_ while asking them to climb.

### 🔧 When It Truly Is About Performance

Of course, there are moments when someone stops showing up — mentally or emotionally.  
When deadlines slip, accountability fades, and the energy just isn’t there anymore.

That’s when leadership becomes a craft of **clarity and courage**.  
You give feedback directly, specifically, and early.  
You set a path for recovery — not a trap for exit.  
You make the expectations unmistakable, and the conversation human.

A good exit leaves **dignity intact**.  
That’s what separates management from leadership.

---

### 🔄 Culture Is What You Tolerate

Every team has people who perform at different levels.  
What defines culture is how you respond to them.

Ignore it, and morale erodes.  
Overcorrect it, and fear takes over.  
Address it with empathy and standards — and you build **trust**.

Because performance isn’t about perfection.  
It’s about **alignment** — between clarity, capability, and care.

### 💬 The Takeaway

Low performers don’t appear out of nowhere.  
They’re signals — signs that something in the system, the structure, or the relationship has drifted.

Before asking _“Why is this person falling behind?”_  
ask _“What made it possible for them to drift this far without being caught?”_

That’s not softness.  
That’s accountability with empathy — the rarest kind of leadership.

---

💡 **Quick takeaway:**  
People don’t fail alone.  
They fail _inside systems_ that stopped seeing them early enough.
